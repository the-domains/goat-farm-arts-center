description: 'One day in early July, in a circa 1910 building on South Broad Street, Elizabeth Jarrett and Kris Pilcher discovered a jar of human teeth. The three-story, 28,000-square-foot South Downtown building had until recently been the office of dentist Dr. Dennis Jaffe. Allegations of Medicaid fraud put an end to the enterprise.'
