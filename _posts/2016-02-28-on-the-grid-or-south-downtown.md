description: "\"Atlanta is changing quickly - blink and you'll barely recognize certain corners, streets, and neighborhoods. But in some areas such as South Downtown, the transformation is happening more slowly and seemingly with a bit more care thanks to folks like the Goat Farm, the Center for Civic Innovation, Mammal Gallery, Eyedrum, and more.\""
