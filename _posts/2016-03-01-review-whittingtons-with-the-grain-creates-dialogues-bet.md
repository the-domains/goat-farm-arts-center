description: "Martha Whittington's With the Grain: Works on Paper, at Sandler Hudson Gallery through March 5, is an exquisite homage to the many virtues of wood: a primal material from which come the human creations of paper, furniture, furniture veneer and lumber for construction, to name only a few end products from trees as transformed after being harvested from nature."
